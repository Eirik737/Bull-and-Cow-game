# Bull-and-Cow-game

This game was created based on a tutorial I was following.
Course can be found at Udemy.com and is called "The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ & Make Games"

Bulls and Cows are a simple text based game where the objective is to guess a word on certain amount of tries.
The word is a isogram which means that the word can only include one of each letter in the alphabet.
